Hi, I'm Ramen!
I'm a very simple TCP-based chat server written in Erlang for a (failed) job application.

Due to "legal reasons", my creator was not allowed to know whether or not I passed inspection.

So please please please, TRY TO BREAK ME!

My creator knows that there's at least one rather careless error in my code, but it's fairly minor. Maybe you can find more?

Make and Run Instructions:

make to compile
make clean to decompile
erl to start the Erlang shell
ramen:start(8888) to start the server on port 8888
ramen:stop() or ctrl+c and then a to stop

Client Connection Protocol:

LOGIN username\r\n = Login
LOGOUT\r\n = Logout
MSG username message\r\n = Message a user
JOIN #room\r\n = Joins existing or creates, then joins a chatroom
PART #room\r\n = Leaves a joined room, removes room if this was last user in room
MSG #room message\r\n = Messages all users in a room

The server will respond with either an OK\r\n or ERROR reason\r\n

Why ramen? It deals with lots of MSG packets.
